# Portfolio Tracker - Development Challenges & Solutions

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the key challenges encountered during the development of the Portfolio Tracker application and the solutions implemented to overcome them.

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Real-Time Stock Data Integration
**Challenge**: Integrating with external financial APIs while handling rate limits, API failures, and data consistency.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented a robust StockDataService with fallback mechanisms
- Added mock data generation for development and testing
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
- Used caching strategies to minimize API calls

**Code Implementation**:
```java
@Service
public class StockDataService {
    // Handles API rate limits with fallback to mock data
    // Implements proper error handling and logging
}
```

### 2. Complex State Management
**Challenge**: Managing complex application state across multiple components with real-time data updates.

**Solution**:
- Implemented Redux Toolkit for predictable state management
